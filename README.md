# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @croclius

Hi! Iâ€™m Muhammad Haseeb Altaf, though most know me online as **Croclius**. I'm driven by curiosity and a passion for cybersecurity, always eager to dive deeper into how things work behind the scenes. I am a penetration tester focused mainly on the Active Directory & Network side of things.

I also love to write when I have time. You can view my blog here: https://croclius.com
